    <h4>Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. 
        These harmful materials are called pollutants.
        Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash and can be made by humans, such as plastic bag.</h4>

    <h3>Types of Pollution</h3>  
    
            <br>
    <h4>Land Pollution</h4>

    <h5>Land pollution refers to the deterioration of the earth's land surfaces, at and below ground level. The cause is the accumulation of solid and liquid waste materials that contaminate groundwater and soil.The higher the permeability of the soil, the more likely that land pollution will occur.</h5>
    <br><br><br>
    <h4>Water Pollution</h4>

    <h5>Water pollution occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, degrading water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment.</h5>
    <br><br><br>
    <h4>Air Pollution</h4>

    <h5>Air pollution is a mixture of solid particles and gases in the air. Car emissions, chemicals from factories, dust, pollen and mold spores may be suspended as particles. Ozone, a gas, is a major part of air pollution in cities. When ozone forms air pollution, it's also called smog. Some air pollutants are poisonous.</h5>
    <br><br><br>
    <h4>Noise Pollution</h4>

    <h5>Noise pollution can be defined as any disturbing or unwanted noise that interferes or harms humans or wildlife. ... Noise pollution has a negative impact on wildlife species by reducing habitat quality, increasing stress levels, and masking other sounds.</h5>
